# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for detecting diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes and can cause blindness if left untreated. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management. This project employs image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify and classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply digital image processing techniques that can improve the classification of retinal images into different levels of diabetic retinopathy severity. The project uses Python and popular machine learning libraries to process the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Features

- Preprocessing of retinal images for noise reduction and normalization.
- Training with labeled data and fine-tuning of hyperparameters.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of training history and model predictions for analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from public repositories containing labeled retinal images. The images are categorized into the following classes:

1. No diabetic retinopathy
2. Mild diabetic retinopathy
3. Moderate diabetic retinopathy
4. Severe diabetic retinopathy
5. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Usage

1. Open the `Diabetic Retinopathy Detection.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
3. Modify parameters and configurations as needed to experiment with different model architectures or preprocessing techniques.

## Results

The trained model's performance is evaluated based on various metrics. The notebook includes visualizations for the training process and sample predictions to showcase the model's effectiveness.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use by medical professionals.
